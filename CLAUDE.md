# Grafema Project

Graph-driven code analysis tool. AI should query the graph, not read code.

## Project Vision

Grafema's core thesis: **AI should query the graph, not read code.**

If reading code gives better results than querying Grafema — that's a product gap, not a workflow choice. Every feature, every decision should move toward this vision: the graph must be the superior way to understand code.

**Target environment:** Massive legacy codebases where:
- Migration to typed languages is economically unfeasible
- Custom build systems, templating engines, internal DSLs
- Untyped or loosely-typed code (JS, PHP, Python, etc.)
- Type systems don't exist or can't help — Grafema fills that gap

Grafema is NOT competing with TypeScript or static type checkers. It's for codebases where those solutions don't apply.

**AI-first tool:** Every function must be documented for LLM-based agents. Documentation should explain when and why to use each capability. UX is designed for agents, not just humans.

## Architecture

- **Plugin-based, modular architecture**
- Modules: `types`, `core`, `cli`, `mcp`, `gui`
- RFDB server (`packages/rfdb-server/`) — Rust graph database, client-server architecture via unix-socket

## Core Principles

### TDD — Tests First, Always

- New features/bugfixes: write tests first
- Refactoring: write tests that lock current behavior BEFORE changing anything
- Refactoring must preserve behavioral identity — output before = output after
- If tests don't exist for the area you're changing, write them first

### DRY / KISS

- No duplication, but don't over-abstract
- Clean, correct solution that doesn't create technical debt
- Avoid clever code — prefer obvious code
- Match existing patterns in the codebase

### Root Cause Policy

**CRITICAL: When behavior or architecture doesn't match project vision:**

1. STOP immediately
2. Do not patch or workaround
3. Identify the architectural mismatch
4. Discuss with user before proceeding
5. Fix from the roots, not symptoms

If it takes longer — it takes longer. No shortcuts.

### Small Commits

- Each commit must be atomic and working
- One logical change per commit
- Tests must pass after each commit

### Reuse Before Build

Before proposing a new subsystem, check if existing Grafema infrastructure can be extended:

| Need | Don't Build | Extend Instead |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| "Check property X of code" | New analysis engine | GuaranteeManager + Datalog rule |
| "Track metadata Y on nodes" | New node type | `metadata` field on existing nodes |
| "Report issue Z to user" | New warning system | ISSUE nodes + existing reporters |
| "Query pattern W" | Custom traversal code | Datalog query |

**Example:** Cardinality Tracking was initially designed as a 7-phase "Complexity Analysis Engine" (21-29 days). After architectural review, it became: CardinalityEnricher (adds metadata) + Datalog rules (checks it) + GuaranteeManager (reports violations). Scope reduced to 11-13 days.

**Key insight:** Grafema's core is graph + Datalog + guarantees. Most features should be: enricher that adds data + Datalog rules that query it.

## Dogfooding

**Use Grafema to work on Grafema.** Hybrid mode: graph for exploration/planning, direct file reads for implementation.

### Setup (per worker)

RFDB server must be running for Grafema queries to work:
```bash
# Start RFDB server (from project root)
/Users/vadim/.local/bin/rfdb-server .grafema/graph.rfdb --socket .grafema/rfdb.sock --data-dir .grafema &

# Rebuild graph after switching branches or pulling changes
node packages/cli/dist/cli.js analyze
```

MCP server configured in `.mcp.json` — provides 25 tools for graph queries. Restart Claude Code after starting RFDB for MCP tools to load.

### Workflow Integration (Hybrid Mode)

**Exploration phase — MUST try graph first.** See `_ai/agents/don.md` for query mapping table.

**Implementation — direct file reads OK:**
- Implementation needs exact code, not summaries
- Graph useful for: finding call sites, checking impact, understanding dependencies

**Auto-Review — use graph for verification:**
- `get_stats` to check graph health after changes
- `check_guarantees` if guarantees are defined

### Tracking Grafema Usage in Metrics

Every task metrics report (`0XX-metrics.md`) MUST include a **Grafema Dogfooding** section:

```markdown
### Grafema Dogfooding

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Graph queries attempted | N |
| Graph queries successful | N (answered the question) |
| Fallbacks to file read | N (graph couldn't answer) |
| Product gaps found | N |

**Gaps found:**
- [what you tried to do] → [why graph couldn't help] → [suggested improvement]

**Verdict:** [useful / partially useful / not useful for this task]
```

### Product Gap Policy

**RFDB auto-start:** The MCP server auto-starts RFDB when needed. No manual `rfdb-server` command required — `RFDBServerBackend` spawns it on first connection attempt (detached, survives MCP exit). Binary is found via `findRfdbBinary()` (monorepo build, PATH, `~/.local/bin`).

**When Grafema falls short:**
1. Note what you tried and why it failed
2. Record in metrics report (Gaps found section)
3. At STEP 4: present gaps to user → if confirmed → create Linear issue (team: Reginaflow, label: `Improvement`, `v0.2`)
4. Difficulties leading to retries = high-priority gaps

### Known Limitations (2026-02-15)

- **Import resolution**: `.js` → `.ts` redirects not followed, graph is incomplete for TS monorepos
- **Incremental analysis**: not yet available (coming with RFDBv2), full re-analyze after changes
- **Classes**: TypeScript classes not extracted as CLASS nodes
- **Graph coverage**: only entry point files analyzed, transitive imports partially resolved

## Process

**Workflow version: v2.1** (2026-02-15)

Changelog:
- **v2.1** — Extracted agent instructions to `_ai/agents/`, added Don Scope Integrity rule, reduced CLAUDE.md by ~21%.
- **v2.0** — Streamlined pipeline: removed Kevlin/Donald from standard flow, Joel only for Full MLA, combined Steve+Вадим auto into single Auto-Review, strengthened Uncle Bob (file-level checks), added model assignment table, parallel Kent ∥ Rob, max 3 subagents, per-task metrics tracking.
- **v1.0** — Original MLA with all personas sequential.

**CRITICAL: NO CODING AT TOP LEVEL!**

All implementation happens through subagents. Top-level agent only coordinates.

### The Team

**Planning:**
- **Don Melton** (Tech Lead) — "I don't care if it works, is it RIGHT?" Analyzes codebase, creates high-level plan, ensures alignment with vision. **MUST use WebSearch** to find existing approaches, prior art, and tradeoffs before proposing solutions.
- **Joel Spolsky** (Implementation Planner) — **Full MLA only.** Expands Don's plan into detailed technical specs with specific steps. Must include Big-O complexity analysis for algorithms. Skip for Single Agent and Mini-MLA.

**Code Quality:**
- **Robert Martin** (Uncle Bob) — Clean Code guardian. Reviews code BEFORE implementation at **file and method level**. Hard limits: file > 300 lines = MUST split, method > 50 lines = candidate for split. Runs in ALL configurations except Single Agent. "One level better" — not perfection, but incremental improvement.

**Implementation:**
- **Kent Beck** (Test Engineer) — TDD discipline, tests communicate intent, no mocks in production paths. Can run **parallel** with Rob when test structure is clear from plan.
- **Rob Pike** (Implementation Engineer) — Simplicity over cleverness, match existing patterns, pragmatic solutions

**Review:**
- **Combined Auto-Review** (auto) — Single subagent combining vision alignment + practical quality. Checks both architectural gaps AND edge cases, regressions, scope creep. Default stance: critical. If REJECT → back to implementation. If APPROVE → present to user.
- **Вадим Решетников** (Final confirmation, human) — Called only AFTER auto-review approves. User sees review summary and confirms or overrides.

**Project Management:**
- **Andy Grove** (PM / Tech Debt) — Manages Linear, prioritizes backlog, tracks tech debt. Ruthless prioritization: what moves the needle NOW?

**Support:**
- **Donald Knuth** (Problem Solver) — **Only when stuck.** Deep analysis instead of more coding. Think hard, provide analysis, don't make changes. NOT part of standard pipeline.

**Research / Consulting (for new features planning):**
- **Robert Tarjan** (Graph Theory) — Graph algorithms, dependency analysis, cycle detection, strongly connected components
- **Patrick Cousot** (Static Analysis) — Abstract interpretation, dataflow analysis, formal foundations
- **Anders Hejlsberg** (Practical Type Systems) — Real-world type inference, pragmatic approach to static analysis
- **Генрих Альтшуллер** (ТРИЗ) - Разбор архитектурных противоречий

**IMPORTANT for Research agents:** Always use **WebSearch** to find existing tools, papers, and approaches before generating recommendations. Don't hallucinate — ground your analysis in real prior art. Brief search is enough, not deep research.

### Model Assignment

Use the cheapest model that can handle the task. **Max 3 parallel subagents** (reduce CPU load).

| Role | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Don (exploration phase) | **Sonnet** | Codebase search needs reasoning for accurate results |
| Don (planning/decisions) | **Sonnet** | Architectural decisions need reasoning |
| Joel (Full MLA only) | **Sonnet** | Technical specs need reasoning |
| Uncle Bob (review) | **Sonnet** | Code quality judgment needs nuance |
| Kent (tests) | **Opus** | Writing correct tests needs top reasoning |
| Rob (implementation) | **Opus** | Writing correct code needs top reasoning |
| Combined Auto-Review | **Sonnet** | Checklist-based review, well-structured |
| Andy Grove (Linear ops) | **Haiku** | Structured CRUD, template-based |
| Save user request | **Haiku** | Formatting and file write |
| Report formatting | **Haiku** | Template-based markdown |
| Donald Knuth (when stuck) | **Opus** | Deep analysis by definition |
| Research agents | **Sonnet** | Need reasoning + WebSearch |

### Lens Selection (When to Use Which Team Configuration)

Not every task needs full MLA. Match team size to task complexity.

**Decision Tree:**

```
START
 ├─ Is production broken? → YES → Single agent (Rob) + post-mortem MLA later
 └─ NO
     ├─ Is this well-understood? (clear requirements, single file, <50 LOC)
     │   → YES → Single agent (Rob)
     └─ NO
         ├─ Does it change core architecture? (affects multiple systems, long-term impact)
         │   → YES → Full MLA (all personas)
         └─ NO → Mini-MLA (Don, Uncle Bob, Kent ∥ Rob, Auto-Review, Vadim)
```

**Configurations:**

| Config | Team | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Single Agent** | Rob (impl + tests) → Auto-Review → Vadim | Trivial changes, hotfixes, single file <50 LOC |
| **Mini-MLA** | Don → Uncle Bob → Kent ∥ Rob → Auto-Review → Vadim | Medium complexity, local scope |
| **Full MLA** | Don → Joel → Uncle Bob → Kent ∥ Rob → Auto-Review → Vadim | Architecture, complex debugging, ambiguous requirements |

`Kent ∥ Rob` = parallel execution when test structure is clear from plan.

Uncle Bob runs in **all configurations except Single Agent**. 6k-line files must never happen again.

**Early Exit Rule:**
- If Don's plan shows <50 LOC single-file change with no architectural decisions → downgrade to Single Agent
- If first 2 expert contributions converge (no new info) → stop, signal saturation

**ROI Guidelines:**

- Simple task (extract helper, fix typo): Single agent. Full MLA = -80% ROI (waste)
- Complex task (architecture change): Full MLA = +113% ROI (worth it)

See `_ai/mla-patterns.md` for detailed methodology.

## Execution Guards

**Any command: max 10 minutes.** No exceptions.

If command takes longer than 10 minutes:
1. Kill immediately
2. This is a design problem, not a waiting problem
3. Refactor to async with progress reporting
4. Split into subtasks with separate progress reports

**Tests:**
- Run atomically — only tests relevant to current change
- `node --test test/unit/specific-file.test.js` > `npm test`
- Single test file: max 30 seconds. Hanging = bug.
- Full suite — only before final commit

**When anything hangs:**
1. Kill, don't wait
2. Analyze: infinite loop? Waiting for input? Sync blocking?
3. Fix root cause — don't retry blindly, don't increase timeout

### Workflow

Tasks are organized under `_tasks/` directory:
```
_tasks/
├── 2025-01-21-feature-name/
│   ├── 001-user-request.md
│   ├── 002-don-plan.md
│   ├── 003-joel-tech-plan.md
│   ├── 004-steve-review.md
│   ├── 005-vadim-review.md
│   └── ...
```

**STEP 1 — SAVE REQUEST:**
- Save user's request to `001-user-request.md` (or `0XX-user-revision.md` for follow-ups)

**STEP 2 — PLAN:**
1. Don explores codebase (Sonnet subagent), then plans (Sonnet subagent) → `0XX-don-plan.md`
2. **Full MLA only:** Joel expands into detailed tech plan `0XX-joel-tech-plan.md`
3. **Auto-Review** (single Sonnet subagent, combined vision + practical check) — if REJECT → back to step 1
4. **If approved → present to user** for manual confirmation
5. Iterate until all approve. If user rejects → back to step 1

**STEP 2.5 — PREPARE (Refactor-First):**

Before implementation, improve the code we're about to touch. This is "Boy Scout Rule" formalized.

1. Don identifies files/methods that will be modified
2. Uncle Bob reviews those files at **file-level** (size, SRP) AND **method-level** (complexity)
3. If refactoring opportunity exists AND is safe:
   - Kent writes tests locking CURRENT behavior (before refactoring)
   - Rob refactors per Uncle Bob's plan
   - Tests must pass — if not, revert and skip refactoring
4. If file is too messy for safe refactoring → skip, create tech debt issue
5. Proceed to STEP 3

**Refactoring scope limits:**
- Only methods we will directly modify
- Max 20% of task time on refactoring
- "One level better" not "perfect":
  - Method 200→80 lines (split into 2-3)
  - 8 params → Parameter Object
  - Deep nesting → early returns
- **NOT allowed:** rename public API, change architecture, refactor unrelated code

**Skip refactoring when:**
- Method < 50 lines and readable
- No obvious wins
- Risk too high (central critical path)
- Would take >20% of task time

**STEP 3 — EXECUTE:**
1. Kent writes tests ∥ Rob implements (parallel when possible), create reports
2. Don reviews results
3. **Auto-Review** (single Sonnet subagent) — if REJECT → back to step 2
4. **If approved → present to user** for manual confirmation
5. Loop until Don, auto-review, AND user ALL agree task is FULLY DONE

**STEP 4 — FINALIZE:**
- Write **task metrics report** (see template below) → `0XX-metrics.md`
- Update linear. Reported tech debt and current limitation MUST be added to backlog for future fix
- If Grafema couldn't help during this task → discuss with user → possibly Linear issue
- Check backlog, prioritize, offer next task
- **IMPORTANT:** Task reports (`_tasks/REG-XXX/`) must be committed to main when merging the task branch. Don't forget to copy them from worker worktrees!

**IMPORTANT:** Don reviews results after execution, not after every individual agent.

### Task Metrics (REQUIRED for every task)

**Top-level agent MUST collect usage data from every subagent call** and write metrics report at STEP 4.

Each `Task` tool call returns `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` in its output. Collect these.

**Blended cost rates** (input+output average):
| Model | $/M tokens |
|-------|------------|
| Haiku | $1.76 |
| Sonnet | $6.60 |
| Opus | $33.00 |

**Template** (`0XX-metrics.md`):
```markdown
## Task Metrics: REG-XXX

**Workflow:** v2.0
**Config:** [Single Agent / Mini-MLA / Full MLA]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Wall clock:** [start time] → [end time] = [duration]

### Subagents

| # | Agent | Model | Tokens | Tools | Duration | Est. Cost |
|---|-------|-------|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Don (explore) | Sonnet | 35,000 | 8 | 15s | $0.23 |
| 2 | Don (plan) | Sonnet | 35,000 | 3 | 25s | $0.23 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Totals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subagents total | N |
| By model | Haiku: N, Sonnet: N, Opus: N |
| Total tokens (subagents) | N |
| Est. subagent cost | $X.XX |
| Top-level overhead | ~20-30% (not tracked) |
| **Est. total cost** | **$X.XX** |
| Auto-review cycles | N (how many REJECT→retry) |

### Grafema Dogfooding

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Graph queries attempted | N |
| Graph queries successful | N |
| Fallbacks to file read | N |
| Product gaps found | N |

**Gaps found:**
- [what you tried] → [why it failed] → [suggested fix]

**Verdict:** [useful / partially useful / not useful]

### Notes
- [workflow observations, bottlenecks, what worked/didn't]
```

**Rules:**
- Metrics are NON-OPTIONAL. Every task gets a metrics report.
- If a subagent doesn't return usage data, note "N/A" and estimate.
- Wall clock = time from user request to user approval (not including PR/CI).
- Auto-review cycles count: 1 = passed first time, 2+ = had rejections.

### When Stuck

1. Call Donald Knuth for deep analysis
2. Do NOT keep trying random fixes
3. If architectural issue discovered → record it → discuss with user → possibly switch tasks

## Agent Instructions

### For All Agents
- Read relevant docs under `_ai/` and `_readme/` before starting
- Write reports to task directory with sequential numbering
- Never write code at top level — only through designated implementation agents

### Agent Configs

When spawning a subagent, read its config file and include contents in the Task prompt.

| Agent | Config | Model |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Don (Tech Lead) | `_ai/agents/don.md` | Sonnet |
| Uncle Bob (Code Quality) | `_ai/agents/uncle-bob.md` | Sonnet |
| Kent (Tests) | `_ai/agents/kent.md` | Opus |
| Rob (Implementation) | `_ai/agents/rob.md` | Opus |
| Auto-Review | `_ai/agents/auto-review.md` | Sonnet |

## Forbidden Patterns

### Never in Production Code
- `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`
- `mock`, `stub`, `fake` (outside test files)
- Empty implementations: `return null`, `{}`
- Commented-out code

### Never Do
- Changes outside scope without discussing first
- "Improvements" nobody asked for
- Refactoring OUTSIDE of STEP 2.5 (refactoring happens in PREPARE, not during EXECUTE)
- Refactoring code unrelated to current task
- Quick fixes or workarounds
- Guessing when you can ask

## Linear Integration

### Teams & Task Prefixes

| Prefix | Linear Team | Scope |
|--------|------------|-------|
| `REG-*` | **Reginaflow** | Grafema product (JS/TS, CLI, MCP, plugins) |
| `RFD-*` | **RFDB** | RFDB v2 storage engine (Rust, internal roadmap tasks) |

When creating issues:
- Team: pick by prefix (see above)
- Project: **Grafema**
- Format: Markdown
- Include: goal, acceptance criteria, context

### Labels (REQUIRED)

**Type labels** (one required):
- `Bug` — broken functionality
- `Feature` — new capability
- `Improvement` — enhancement to existing
- `Research` — investigation, analysis

**Version labels** (one required):
- `v0.1.x` — bugs and polish for current release
- `v0.2` — Early Access prep, Data Flow, Tech Debt
- `v0.3` — stability, onboarding, infrastructure
- `v0.5+` — strategic (GUI, Systema, Research)

### Version Assignment Criteria

| Version | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| `v0.1.x` | Blocks current usage, critical bugs, CLI/MCP polish |
| `v0.2` | Early Access blockers, data flow features, parallelizable tech debt |
| `v0.3` | Release workflow, onboarding UX, performance optimization |
| `v0.5+` | GUI visualization, Systema automation, research/articles |

### When Completing Tasks

Linear workflow with worktrees:
1. Code ready in worktree → **In Review**
2. After merge to main → **Done**
3. Remove worktree after merge
4. If tech debt discovered → create new issue with appropriate version label
5. If limitation documented → create issue for future fix

Available statuses:
- **Backlog** / **Todo** → ready to start
- **In Progress** → working in worktree
- **In Review** → code ready, waiting for merge
- **Done** → merged to main, worktree removed
- **Canceled** / **Duplicate** → cancelled tasks

### Vibe-kanban Sprint Board

**Source of truth for current sprint.** Linear remains backlog/planning tool.

**Workflow:**
1. Sprint start: open v0.2 tasks from Linear loaded into vibe-kanban (`npx vibe-kanban`)
2. During sprint: work from vibe-kanban board. New tech debt → create in BOTH kanban and Linear
3. Sprint end: run `_scripts/sync-vk-to-linear.sh` to mark completed tasks in Linear

**Vibe-kanban API:** `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/` (port in `/tmp/vibe-kanban/vibe-kanban.port`)
- `GET /api/tasks?project_id=<id>` — list tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` — create task (body: `{project_id, title, description}`)
- `PATCH /api/tasks/<id>` — update (body: `{status: "done"}`)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/<id>` — delete (**no confirmation, be careful**)

**Task naming convention:** `REG-XXX: Title [PRIORITY]` — always include Linear ID for traceability.

**MCP:** vibe-kanban MCP server configured in settings. Requires backend running (`npx vibe-kanban`). Restart Claude Code after starting backend for MCP tools to load.

**IMPORTANT:** `delete_task` has NO confirmation. Don't use bulk delete operations. Prefer status changes over deletion.

## Git Worktree Workflow

**CRITICAL: Worker Slots Pattern**

Fixed number of worktree "slots" for parallel work. Each slot runs persistent Claude Code instance.

### Initial Setup (done once)

```bash
cd /Users/vadimr/grafema
git worktree add ../grafema-worker-1
git worktree add ../grafema-worker-2
...
git worktree add ../grafema-worker-8
```

Each worker runs Claude Code in its own terminal. Workers persist across tasks.

### Starting New Task in a Worker

User will tell Claude which task to work on. Claude then:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull

# Create task branch
git checkout -b task/REG-XXX
```

**IMPORTANT:** Git operations (fetch, checkout, branch creation) are safe and require NO user confirmation.

**CRITICAL — After branch created, IMMEDIATELY:**
1. **Update Linear → In Progress** (use `mcp__linear__update_issue` with `state: "In Progress"`)
2. Save task description to `_tasks/REG-XXX/001-user-request.md`

Do NOT start coding until Linear status is updated.

### Finishing Task

1. Code ready → run **Combined Auto-Review** (single Sonnet subagent)
2. If REJECT → fix issues, don't bother user, re-run review
3. If APPROVE → present review summary to user (real Вадим)
4. User confirms → create PR, Linear status → **In Review**
5. CI must pass. If CI fails → fix, push, wait for green
6. User will merge and `/clear` to start next task

### Review & Merge Process

**Two-stage review:**

| Stage | Who | Mode | On REJECT |
|-------|-----|------|-----------|
| 1. Auto-Review | Single Sonnet subagent | Automatic | Fix, retry — no user involvement |
| 2. Вадим (human) | User | Manual | Fix per feedback, retry from stage 1 |

**Stage 1 — Combined Auto-Review (vision + practical + code quality):**
- Vision alignment, no hacks or shortcuts?
- Tests actually test what they claim?
- Edge cases, regressions, scope creep?
- Code quality, naming, structure?
- Commits atomic, messages clear?

**Stage 2 — Вадим manual (final confirmation):**
- User sees auto-review summary
- User confirms or rejects with feedback
- If confirmed → merge to main, update Linear → **Done**

After merge, task branch can be deleted (optional cleanup).

### Directory Structure

```
/Users/vadimr/
├── grafema/              # Main repo (coordination, PR reviews, releases)
├── grafema-worker-1/     # Worker slot 1 (persistent)
├── grafema-worker-2/     # Worker slot 2 (persistent)
...
├── grafema-worker-8/     # Worker slot 8 (persistent)
```

### Rules

1. **Never work in main repo** — only in worker slots
2. **Workers persist across tasks** — no need to recreate
3. **One worker = one terminal = one CC instance** — stays running
4. **Task switching within worker:**
   ```bash
   # After /clear
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b task/REG-YYY
   ```
5. **Commit often** — branches are in git, safe even if worker reset

### Managing Workers

Check active workers:
```bash
cd /Users/vadimr/grafema
git worktree list
```

If worker gets corrupted, recreate it:
```bash
git worktree remove ../grafema-worker-N --force
git worktree add ../grafema-worker-N
```

## Agent Teams (Experimental)

Agent Teams — экспериментальная фича Claude Code для координации нескольких инстансов с shared task list и межагентным messaging. Включена в settings.

### Когда использовать

- **Параллельный research** — несколько гипотез одновременно
- **Code review с разных ракурсов** — security, performance, test coverage
- **Независимые модули** — каждый тиммейт владеет своим набором файлов
- **Debugging** — конкурирующие гипотезы, тиммейты спорят друг с другом

### Когда НЕ использовать

- MLA workflow (Don → Joel → Kent → Rob) — для этого worktrees + персистентные инстансы
- Задачи с зависимостями между шагами — sequential work
- Правки в одних и тех же файлах — конфликты неизбежны

### Ограничения (на февраль 2026)

- **No session resumption** — если лид падает, команда теряется
- **One team per session** — нельзя несколько команд
- **Тиммейты не персистентны** — создаются заново каждый раз
- **No nested teams** — тиммейты не спавнят своих тиммейтов

### Обязательно

После каждого использования Agent Teams — записать в задачу/комментарий:
1. Была ли реальная польза vs обычные subagents?
2. Сколько примерно токенов потрачено (субъективно: много/умеренно)?
3. Какие проблемы возникли?

Это нужно для принятия решения — продолжать ли использовать или откатиться.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build                                              # Build all packages (REQUIRED before tests)
node --test --test-concurrency=1 'test/unit/*.test.js'  # Run all unit tests
node --test test/unit/specific-file.test.js             # Run single test file
```

**CRITICAL: Tests run against `dist/`, not `src/`.** Always `pnpm build` before running tests after any TypeScript changes. Stale builds cause false failures that look like real bugs.

## Skills

Project-specific skills are available in `.claude/skills/`. Key skills:

### /release
**Skill:** `grafema-release`

Use when publishing new versions to npm. Covers:
- Unified versioning across all packages
- Automated pre-flight checks (tests, clean git, CI status)
- CHANGELOG.md updates
- Building packages
- Publishing with correct dist-tags (beta/latest)
- Automatic stable branch merge
- CI/CD validation via GitHub Actions

**Trigger:** User says "release", "publish", "bump version"

**Quick command:** `./scripts/release.sh patch --publish`

### Other Skills

See `.claude/skills/` for debugging skills:
- `grafema-cli-dev-workflow` — build before running CLI
- `grafema-cross-file-operations` — enrichment phase for cross-file edges
- `pnpm-workspace-publish` — use `pnpm publish` not `npm publish`
